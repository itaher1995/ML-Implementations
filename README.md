# ML-Implementations
Implementation of popular machine learning algorithms in Python

This was done as various programming assignments for my supervised machine learning class. The motivation for these assignments was to help students understand the theory behind these algorithms by programming them.

All algorithms come with a regularized algorithm, meaning they are built to prevent overfitting. They are also built with grid search and K Fold Cross-Validation built in.

These are not commercial algorithms. No testing has been done on larger datasets. These are the most naive implementations of these algorithms.
